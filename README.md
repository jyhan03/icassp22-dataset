# Overview 
This repository provides the dataset and its simulation code used in our ICASSP22 paper titled "DPCCN: Densely-Connected Pyramid Complex Convolutional Network for Robust Speech Separation And Extraction". 

The simulation code of in-domain and source domain dataset can be found in [Yi Luo](https://github.com/yluo42/TAC/tree/master/data) and [Libri2Mix](https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix), respectively. 

# Dataset Generation
For constructing the target domain dataset, Aishell2Mix, please refers to the [scripts](https://github.com/jyhan03/icassp22/tree/main/scripts):

* `data_select.py`, randomly select the clean speech from [Aishell-1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05522.pdf) to generate the mixed speech pairs.
* `data_simu.py`, generate Aishell2Mix mixture using the `data_select.py` results.
* `run_simu.sh`, a simple shell running script for `data_simu.py`.
* `flac2wav`, transform the original LibriSpeech to `.wav` mode and 8k sample rate.
* `get_aux_aishell.py`, generate enrollment speech for Aishell2Mix.
* `get_aux_libri.py`, generate enrollment speech for Libri2Mix.


# Simulated Results
The simulated results can be found in `lst`, where `*_cfg.lst` is the config file generated by `data_simu.py` and `*_aux.lst` is enrollment speech list generated by `get_aux_aishell.py` and `get_aux_libri.py`. 

To get same experimental results, we recommend to comment the config file generation code in `data_simu.py` and use our provided `*_cfg.lst` directly.
